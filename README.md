# coinbase

Go client for the Coinbase v2 API with a binary client as well

### Why

All Go clients for the Coinbase API were using API v1. I wanted a client
using API v2, so I did it myself.

This repository also contains a coinbase binary, you can install it with:

```console
$ go get github.com/caarlos0/coinbase
$ coinbase --help
```
